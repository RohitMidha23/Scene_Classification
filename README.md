# Scene_Classification
The current model is horrible. I don't know where I am going wrong. Maybe need to try out ResNet or something.

Increasing the parameter size is not a good idea. Nearly 97% GPU usage. Not good.

Train accuracy seems to be good but test accuracy seems to be horrible. Nearly 4%.


Might have to take up a ResNet50, and few other trained models and then perform logisticRegression keeping one with highest initial accuracy as y value.
